This file was a group project in the .net boot camp with teksystems.
The team members where Niklas Romero, Cameron Glover, Ryan Holm, & Nayef Taleb.

I made the login page, the dashboard page, the employees menu, the form builder, data store,
the framework for the slices, and the api file for relative pathing. The application uses 
axios to make requests to an api and react for the functionality.
