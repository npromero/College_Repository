/**
 * CLASS: AbstractStock
 * DESCRIPTION Encapsulates information about a stock on the date indicated by
 *              the timestamp. The information encapsulated is:
 *              symbol: the ticker symbol of the stock (e.g. MSFT for Microsoft)
 *              timestamp: 11:59pm on the trading day when the data was obtained
 *              open: the opening price of the stock
 *              high: the highest price at which the stock traded that day
 *              low: the lowest price at which the stock traded that day
 *              close: the price at the end of trading for the day
 *              volume: the number of shares traded that day
 * NOTES:
 * 1. A timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970,
 *    00:00:00 GMT up to a specific date. You should assume the time for all
 *    dates is 11:59pm. This will encompass a whole day of trading.
